# Kombat Akademy - Mortal Kombat 11

A strategy guide website for the fighting game *Mortal Kombat 11*. This project started in 2019 and has since been abandoned. All code has been made open source and is free to use. Information and code by Raptor_FGC / RedRaptor10.

The site provides information for character data, frame data, combos, guides. A lot of content was removed due to being poorly optimized and taking up too much resources. This along with Gfycat being taken down, I didn't want to have to redo everything for a game that was no longer being supported. With *Mortal Kombat 1*'s release, the site was completely redone, although that has also been discontinued for other reasons. This repository is purely for archival purposes. A lot of this was poorly coded and has been refactored for the new site.

*Note: WordPress site, pages, and database must be set up separately if you want to use the site. I will not provide resources for how to set those up.*
